Scenario: The math application successfully loads in your web browser.

* When the math application loads, two random numbers should be viewable. 
    * Page refresh should load a new set of random numbers.
    * The page title should read "MathTutorApp".
    * "Math Challenge" should be displayed at the top of the application and be aligned center-left.
    * "Addition" should fall under "Math Challenge" and be aligned center-left. 
    * The random numbers should be vertically stacked with the addition symbol to their left. 
    * The "Answers" input field should be below the solid black line. The solid black line separates the random numbers from the input field.
