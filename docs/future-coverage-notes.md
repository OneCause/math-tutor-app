- # Future Coverage Notes – Math Tutor App

  These are areas that were not included in the current assignment scope but would be essential for a production-quality release.

  ## Functional Enhancements

  - **Error Messaging & Validation Feedback**  
    Improve user experience by replacing or augmenting `window.alert()` with contextual, in-page validation messages and accessible feedback components.
  - **Accessibility (A11y)**  
    Ensure keyboard-only navigation, semantic markup, ARIA roles, and screen reader support are in place. Test compatibility with common assistive technologies (VoiceOver, TalkBack, NVDA).
  - **Internationalization (i18n) & Localization (L10n)**  
    Prepare the app for translation and regional formatting (e.g., number formats, right-to-left text, alert language).
  - **Support for Additional Operations**  
    Expand functionality beyond addition to include subtraction, multiplication, division, or even multi-step equations.

  ## Cross-Platform Testing & Responsiveness

  - **Cross-Browser Compatibility**  
    Confirm consistent behavior in the latest and previous versions of major browsers:
    - Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge (Chromium)
    - Focus on input behavior (`type="number"`), alert functionality, and styling
  - **Responsive Design & Viewport Testing**  
    Verify UI behavior and layout across screen sizes:
    - Desktop, tablet, and mobile breakpoints
    - Ensure tap targets are accessible and content scales appropriately
  - **Mobile Device Testing (Real Devices and Emulators)**  
    Validate app behavior on actual mobile hardware using native browsers (Safari on iOS, Chrome on Android). Confirm keyboard handling, touch accuracy, and viewport scaling.

  ## Platform Version Coverage Guidelines

  In a full QA cycle, we recommend using a “latest and -1” approach for platform testing:

  - **Browsers**: Test each major browser in its most recent version and one prior version (e.g., Chrome 125 and 124)
  - **Mobile Operating Systems**: Test on the latest iOS and Android versions and one previous major release
  - **Device Coverage**: At minimum, validate on current-generation iPhone and Android devices (e.g., iPhone 14 and Pixel 7 or equivalent)

  This ensures broad compatibility with real-world usage patterns without overextending test scope.

  ## Additional Suggestions

  - **Performance Baseline**  
    Add performance measurements (e.g., input latency, load time) once UI complexity increases.
  - **Test Hook Infrastructure**  
    If the app grows, add test IDs or hook-friendly selectors to make E2E automation more stable.
  - **Code Quality and Linting**  
    Enforce linting and static analysis to prevent regression bugs and encourage maintainability.
