   * Angular DI for external InjectionTokens (like ToastConfig).
   *
   * Since the intent of this test is likely to verify high-level success/error delegation,
   * mocking ToastrService and providing TOAST_CONFIG manually would be required.
   *
   * ✅ AppComponent already indirectly covers this logic via its test with a mocked MessageService.
   *
   * TODO: If direct unit testing of MessageService is required in the future,
   * mock both ToastrService methods and provide TOAST_CONFIG in TestBed.
